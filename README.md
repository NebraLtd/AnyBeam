#Nebra AnyBeam

Resources for the Nebra AnyBeam range of Pico laser projectors, originally funded through KickStarter. Nebra AnyBeam is the worlds smallest pocket projector with the power to project a crystal clear picture on any surface. Simply plug and play with your smart phone, laptop or tablet to watch your favourite content on the big screen, powered by an ordinary power bank or from a USB port on your computer.

##Overview

The AnyBeam pico laser projectors technology is super efficient and does not generate excessive amounts of heat, like some older generation of projectors. This in turn means that we don't need to add any noisy fans inside to keep everything nice and cool, it will never interrupt your viewing experience.

AnyBeam uses lasers instead of the traditional LEDs or bulbs. This increases the overall lifetime by a factor of 10 over those traditional methods. Over many years this drastically saves money throughout its lifetime.

The laser MEMS technology, which is at the heart of the Nebra AnyBeam projector range is incredibly light and compact. This means we were able to fit it into a small form factor and even produce a HAT board for the Raspberry Pi, allowing you to literally take it anywhere you want.

**Features:**

* Low Power -  consumption as low as 3W
* Focus Free - Always in focus as the laser beam barely spreads
* No Bulb - Utilises a MEMS scanner which means no bulb is required
* Fanless - MEMS scanner reduces the need for a fan, no noise!
* Light Weight - Weighs just 140g
* Pocket Size - Low profile form factor
